# 3.3. CMake

Now that we have seen how to compile C++ code manually, we will discuss
build automation using CMake. Generally, compiling manually is bad
because it's difficult for someone to download your repo and just
build it. Building the repo should not be burdensome.

## 3.3.1. Setup

Change directory to this tutorial.
```bash
cd ${SCS_TUTORIAL}/3.3.building_cpp_cmake
```

## 3.3.2. Basic C++ Repo Structure

Generally, a C++ repo will contain at least the following directories
1. include: where public header files go
2. src: where private source and header files go
3. test: where unit tests go

Note: A unit test is just an program which validates the correctness
of some component of your program.

## 3.3.3. The CMakeList.txt

In CMake, build configurations are stored in files called CMakeLists.txt.
In each directory which has source code or contains a directory which
has source code, there should be a file called CMakeLists.txt. The
CMakeLists.txt is responsible for determining which source codes are
used for building a library or executable, dependencies, etc.

## 3.3.4. The Root CMake

First we will look at the CMakeLists.txt file in the project's root
directory. Generally, the root CMake is responsible for the following:
1. Finding packages (e.g., shared libraries) which are relevant to the build
2. Defining user configuration options
3. Setting global compiler flags

```cmake
```
