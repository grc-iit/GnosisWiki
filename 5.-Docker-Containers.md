This is a brief guide on how to use Docker.

# 5.1. Installation

For ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install docker
```

For RHEL
```
sudo yum install docker
```

# 5.2. Docker Basics

## 5.2.1. Create a dockerfile
Below is an example Dockerfile which creates an Ubuntu20.04 container.
```docker
# Install ubuntu 20.04
FROM ubuntu:20.04
LABEL maintainer="llogan@hawk.iit.edu"
LABEL version="0.0"
LABEL description="An example docker image"

# Disable Prompt During Packages Installation
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Update ubuntu
RUN apt update && apt install

# Install some basic packages
RUN apt install -y \
    openssh-server \
    sudo

# Set an environment variable
ENV MY_VAR=hi

# Print environment variable
RUN echo ${MY_VAR}
```

## 5.2.2. Build the container image

First, the container image must be built. This is just a file which represents the container. 
The syntax is as follows:
```bash
sudo docker build -t [IMAGE_NAME] [DOCKERFILE_DIR, can be a github link] -f [DOCKERFILE_NAME]
```
1. IMAGE_NAME: a semantic name for the image being built
2. DOCKERFILE_DIR: the directory containing the dockerfile
3. DOCKERFILE_NAME: the name of the dockerfile in that directory. This is optional. Default: Dockerfile.

Let's say that our Dockerfile is located at ${HOME}/MyDockerfiles/Dockerfile.
We could build the image two ways:
```
# Option 1: a single command
cd ${HOME}

# Option 2: cd into the directory
cd ${HOME}/MyDockerfiles/Dockerfile
sudo docker build -t MyImage .
```

## 5.2.3. Run the container

Next, we must run the container. This will parse the Dockerfile and run all commands. 
The syntax is as follows:
```bash
sudo docker run --name [CONTAINER_ID] --network host [IMAGE_NAME]
```

This command will create a container CONTAINER_ID from IMAGE_NAME which uses the host network to connect to the internet and download packages.

## 5.2.4. Interacting with the container

You can still use the container after running. The syntax is as follows:
```bash
# If the container is not started
sudo docker start -i [CONTAINER_ID]

# If the container is started
sudo docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID]
```

You can now run commands within the image.

## 5.2.5. Useful Commands
```bash
# List all running containers
sudo docker container ls

# List all container IDs
sudo docker container ls --all

# Start a container that has been stopped with an interactive shell
sudo docker start -i [CONTAINER_ID]

# Terminal of running container
docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID]

# Kill a running container
sudo docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]

# Delete a container
sudo docker rm [CONTAINER_ID]

# Commit the state of a container CONTAINER_ID into a new container
# COPY_CONTAINER_ID
sudo docker commit [CONTAINER_ID] [COPY_CONTAINER_ID]
```
