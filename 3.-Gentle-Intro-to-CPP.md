C/C++ are the main programming languages used for modern HPC programs. While
this is also evolving, this is the current standard. Here we give a brief
tutorial on how to structure a C++ repo.

We will walk through a simple example demonstrating all core C++ concepts.

# 3.1. Choosing a Compiler

There are many C++ compilers.
1. **GNU compiler collection (GCC)**: The standard C/C++ compiler provided
on most Linux systems. Linux-only.
2. **Clang**: Clang provides various extensions that can be used to build
custom compiler add-ons. Cross-platform. Standard on Mac.
3. **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**: The standard C/C++ compiler for Windows.
4. **Intel Compiler**: Sometimes used. Optimizations for intel products.
5. **MinGW**: Like gcc, except works on Windows.

Generally, we prioritize compiling for Linux systems. This means we typically
focus on gcc and occasionally clang. Clang is a more modern compiler with
many advanced features and better warnings and error messages. However,
we generally focus on gcc.

# 3.0. Manual Building

First we will give some historical context on how to build C++ code manually.

## 3.0.1. Setup


```bash

```

# 3.1. CMake

CMake is a build system primarily targeted for compiling C/C++ code. It

# 3.5. Basic Types

# 3.6. Conditionals (if, switch)

# 3.7. Loops (for, while)

# 3.8. Classes, methods and functions

# 3.9. File Input and Output
