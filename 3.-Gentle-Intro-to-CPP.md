C/C++ are the main programming languages used for modern HPC programs. While this is also evolving, this is the current standard. Here we give a brief tutorial on how to structure a C++ repo. 

We will walk through a simple example demonstrating all core C++ concepts.

# 3.1. Directory Structure

# 3.2. CMake

# 3.3. The "main" function

# 3.4. Printing

# 3.5. Basic Types

# 3.6. Conditionals (if, switch)

# 3.7. Loops (for, while)

# 3.8. Classes, methods and functions

# 3.9. File Input and Output

# 3.10. The Standard Library (STL)

# 3.11. Iterators

# 3.12. Memory Management

# 3.12.1. New and delete

# 3.12.2. unique_ptr

# 3.12.3. shared_ptr
