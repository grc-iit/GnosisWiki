Now that we have seen how to compile C++ code manually, we will discuss
build automation using CMake. Generally, compiling manually is bad
because it's difficult for someone to download your repo and just
build it. Building the repo should not be burdensome.

The main objective of this tutorial is to show you how to build the application
in the previous example. For the majority of the tutorial, we will use

# 3.3.1. Setup

Change directory to this tutorial.
```bash
cd ${SCS_TUTORIAL}/3.3.building_cpp_cmake
```

# 3.3.2. Basic C++ Repo Structure

Generally, a C++ repo will contain at least the following directories
1. include: where public header files go
2. src: where private source and header files go
3. test: where unit tests go

Note: A unit test is just an program which validates the correctness
of some component of your program.

In CMake, build configurations are stored in files called CMakeLists.txt.
In each directory which has source code or contains a directory which
has source code, there should be a file called CMakeLists.txt. The
CMakeLists.txt is responsible for determining which source codes are
used for building a library or executable, dependencies, etc.

# 3.3.3. Building a CMake Project

To build this project, do the following:
```bash
cd ${SCS_TUTORIAL}/3.3.building_cpp_cmake
mkdir build
cd build
# CMake will produce a Makefile (in this case)
cmake ../
# Use make to build
make -j8
```

CMake is a build system generator, so it doesn't always need to
be a makefile which gets produced. It could also be something
like ninja.

# 3.3.4. Top-Level (or Root) CMakeLists.txt

First we will look at the CMakeLists.txt file in the project's root
directory. Generally, the root CMake is responsible for the following:
1. Finding packages (e.g., shared libraries) which are relevant to the build
2. Defining user configuration options
3. Setting variables global to the build
4. Setting compiler flags (e.g., optimization)

In this section, we will describe our root [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/scs-lab/scs-tutorial/blob/main/3.3.building_cpp_cmake/CMakeLists.txt).

## 3.3.4.1. CMake Preamble
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.10)
project(MyFirstCMake)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
```

Here we require a minimum of CMake 3.10. This will cause CMake to fail
if the installed version is too old.

We also set the name of this project to be MyFirstCMake. The *project*
function will set the name of this project and store it in the variable PROJECT_NAME. Calling from the top-level CMakeLists.txt also stores the project name in the variable CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME.

## 3.3.4.2. Global Compiler Flags
```cmake
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compiler optimization
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add_compile_options("-fPIC")
if (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Debug")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -O0")
elseif(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "RelWithDebInfo")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -O2")
elseif(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Release")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -03")
else()
  message(FATAL_ERROR "Invalid build type: ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}")
endif()
```

CMake defines the following variables automatically:
1. CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD: The C++ version. For now C++17.
2. CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: What mode to build your project in. Typically
this indicates compiler optimization. Default is usually RelWithDebInfo
3. CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS: Flags to pass to the compiler. By default, this
will be equivalent to the CXX_FLAGS environment variable from the
shell CMake gets executed in.

In this example, we define three CMAKE_BUILD_TYPES:
1. Debug: no compiler optimization
2. RelWithDebInfo: moderate compiler optimization
3. Release: heavy compiler optimization

These build types are very common in CMake projects.

In section 3.2, we mentioned that the -fPIC flag was required when
building a shared library. In CMake this can be done as follows:
```cmake
add_compile_options("-fPIC")
```

For each CMake build type, we also enable different levels of optimization.
For debug, we did this as follows:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -O0")
```

Setting CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and add_compile_options are effectively the same thing. In this case, it would also be equivalent (and actually encouraged) to write:
```cmake
add_compile_options("-O0")
```
However, in many C++ projects people will set CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS. The main difference between the two approaches is that CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS will apply globally, even if set in a lower-level CMakeLists.txt. This is partially
due to historical reasons.


## 3.3.4.3. Build Options
```cmake
option(BUILD_TESTING "Build testing kits" OFF)
```

The option command allows users to configure the build. In this case, we include
a flag which indicates whether or not to build unit tests. In many cases, users
won't want to take the time to test code unless there are potential
portability issues. By default, this value is set to OFF. The alternative is to
set it to ON.

CMake options are passed to CMake using the -D flag. To build this project with testing, do the following:
```bash
cd ${SCS_TUTORIAL}/3.3.building_cpp_cmake
mkdir build
cd build
# Enable testing
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TESTING=ON
# Build
make -j8
```

## 3.3.4.4. Locating Dependencies

```cmake
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dependencies common to all subdirectories
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
find_package(OpenMP REQUIRED COMPONENTS C CXX)
find_package(Boost)
```

find_package is used to locate packages installed on the system by parsing the environment variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH must contain the
paths to .cmake (not .txt) files which actually load the package information.
This variable is often set by spack when loading packages.

## 3.3.4.5. Enable Testing
```cmake
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Enable Testing
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
include(CTest)
if(CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME STREQUAL MyFirstCMake AND BUILD_TESTING)
  enable_testing()
endif()
```

This code will enable the ability to use a functionality called CTest.
CTests are used for automating unit tests for C++ projects. In our
case, this is only enabled when BUILD_TESTING is ON.

## 3.3.4.5. Directory Descent

```cmake
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Source
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
add_subdirectory(src)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Testing Sources
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
if(CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME STREQUAL MyFirstCMake AND BUILD_TESTING)
  add_subdirectory(test)
endif()
```

There is no source code in the root directory for this project. In
order to get to the source code, we must go into the src and test
directories. add_subdirectory will tell CMake to go to a specific
directory and execute the CMakeLists.txt in that subdirectory.
