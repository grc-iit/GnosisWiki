# Linux Environments

All top500 supercomputers and the majority of cloud systems run Linux. This tutorial will cover the basic aspects of using Linux for developing systems software.

## Choosing an OS

### Choosing a distro
There are many Linux distributions out there, and they all have different quirks. The following is a list of distros which are currently being used, or we expect may eventually be used 
1. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop): we use Ubuntu currently in our cluster. It's not widely used in HPC, but it's a mature, well-maintained distro. There are many ubuntu-like systems (e.g., Linux Mint), feel free to use any of them. **We recommend using an ubuntu-like system for the purposes of our research**.
2. [Centos7/8](https://www.centos.org/download/): CentOS 7 and 8 are used pretty commonly in HPC. However, they have been discontinued. We don't recommend using them for your main OS, but you should be aware you may have to deal with them for software portability
3. [Rocky](https://rockylinux.org/): a replacement to CentOS, and is a potential candidate for HPC systems. 
4. [Alma](https://almalinux.org/): another CentOS-like system, which is also a potential candidate for HPC systems

### What if I have Windows?

Microsoft Windows has the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It's competent for the majority of Linux development. If you don't want to kill your current windows installation, WSL should be sufficient for most cases of our research. WSL provides an **Ubuntu** installation. Follow (Microsoft's instructions)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install] on how to enable WSL (it likely is not by default).

### What if I have a Mac?

Mac's are a bit tricky. Mac and Linux are NOT the same thing. Generally speaking, we highly recommend developing on a Linux distribution which is similar to what is used in HPC. Unfortunately, Macs don't have something like WSL. We recommend using either a container (e.g., Docker/Singularity) or a virtual machine (VirtualBox/Qemu) for development. Generally, containers are much faster than VMs. We recommend using a container for **Ubuntu**.

## The Linux Basics

In this section, we will use Ubuntu 22.04 as our Linux distro.

### Command line basics

### What are environment variables?

Environment variables are used to store some sort of information without having to hard-code it each time. The basic example are paths. There are various useful environment variables

#### ${HOME}

#### ${USER}

#### ${PWD}

### SSH

SSH is a secure way of connecting to a remote machine. SSH relies on public-private key cryptography to secure the connection. The private key is a secret that only you should know. The public key should be given to other people. Generally, RSA is used as the algorithm for generating keys.

#### Creating the keys

**SSH keys can be given passwords, but we recommend against**. We consider the SSH key itself to be secret enough that a password is completely unnecessary. This is referred to as "passwordless-ssh". **Passwordless-ssh is required for many HPC programs**.

To create a public/private key pair, run the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen
```

The default names for the keys are as follows:
1. The private key is "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
2. The public key is "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

You can use other names (it doesn't have to be id_rsa), **but we recommend against this in general**. Many SSH-based tools become cumbersome with keys which are non-default.

#### Ensuring permissions

SSH is very particular about the permissions of the ~/.ssh directory and the files in that directory. Below describes the permissions that need to be set to make SSH behave.

For convenience, feel free to copy-paste this. A detailed description of what these do is under "How does chmod work?"
```bash
sudo chmod 700 ${HOME}/.ssh
sudo chmod 644 ${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
sudo chmod 600 ${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa
sudo chmod 600 ${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 600 ${HOME}/.ssh/config
```

##### How does chmod work?

chmod stands for "change mode". It has the following syntax
```bash
sudo chmod [mode] [path]
```
* "mode" is a 3-digit code. 
* Each digit is between 0 and 7
* The digits have the following meaning: [owner] [group] [user]
* owner: typically you
* group: files can be apart of a group. Only one group per file or directory.
* user: typically anyone other than you

A single digit can have the following values:
0: No permissions
1: Execute only
2: Write only
3: Write and execute
4: Read only
5: Read and execute
6: Read and write
7: Read, write, and execute

```bash
# The SSH directory
# Owner has read, write, execute permissions. 
# No one else can touch this directory.
sudo chmod 700 ${HOME}/.ssh

# The public key
# Owner has read + write permissions.
# Other users can read this file
sudo chmod 644 ${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# The private key
# Owner has read + write permissions
# Nobody else has permissions
sudo chmod 600 ${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa

# Authorized keys
# Owner has read + write permissions
# Nobody else has permissions
sudo chmod 600 ${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys

# User Config
# Owner has read + write permissions
# Nobody else has permissions
sudo chmod 600 ${HOME}/.ssh/config
```
